## Easy Challenges
### Logcat

This challenge is meant to introduce students to `adb` and the `logcat` tool, as well as decompilation, since the challenge can be solved through reverse engineering as well. Although easy, it provides a good first step into mobile CTFing.

### Shaorma

This challenge is meant to introduce students to `jadx` for decompilation, to hash decryption and file obfuscation. This is a two step challange where the first step offers a hit for decrypting the flag.

### Login

More forensics (exiftool, binwalk)

### Reverse (iOS)

Reverse logic to rebuild flag

### Extraction (iOS)

Forensics shit


## Medium Challenges

### IVDrip

This challenge can be approached either by employing Frida to modify a segment of the flag decryption code, or by replicating the behavior of the decryption function in a different programming language, such as Python.
